We need to coin flip head or tails game that integrates with twitch chat.

There needs to be audio and a visual component to it.

This should be 3d and use a front and back graphic for the coin.

This needs a command that two people can !username to challenge each other.

This should be able to be triggered from twitch chat.

When the command is triggered, there should be a count down, then the coin flip animation should play with sound effects.

This should show the user who won the coin flip in chat as well as on screen.
